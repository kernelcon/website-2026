Featuring live performances by nerdcore legends YTcracker and Dual Core - because nothing hits quite like sudo rhymes through a proper sound system.</p><p>The Setup:</p><ul class='activity-bullets'><li>Open bar & proper food (no pizza this time, we promise)</li><li>Actually fun networking that won't make you want to ctrl+alt+del</li><li>Live music that speaks to both your inner dev and party protocol</li></ul><p>Look, we know most tech events are about as exciting as watching your code compile. This isn't that. This is where the real threads connect.</p><p>Quick heads up: Word in the repo is there's a surprise belt event happening. That's all we can say for now.</p></div>"
